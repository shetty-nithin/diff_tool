Observation 1:
    Difference Report generated using LCS algorithm shows all the lines from the A.txt are DELETED and all the lines from the B.txt are INSERTED.

    When the DP table is ready, it stores the information about the cost(number of edit required) of coverting one string to another.
    When the lines of both A.txt and B.txt matches, then there is no cost of edit. If the lines doent match and if the subsequences dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1],
    costs the same edit, it creates an issue.
    Because, as per the current algorithm, line of A.txt is assumed to be DELETED. Therefore all the lines in the A.txt file are stored as DELETED. And once i !> 0, 
    remaining lines of B.txt will stored as INSERTED.
    
    This means, the algorithm is biased towards DELETION fist.
